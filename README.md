#### What is OOPS?

- OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
- It is not just a programming language, but a paradigm (An example or model used to explain a concept or theory).
- OOP does not tell you how to program, rather it tells you how to go about designing your software. 
- When you are developing Object-oriented programs/software the emphasis is more on how you think about and design the software   rather that on actually implementing(coding) it.
